<p class="h6">Smart Parking systems typically obtains information about available parking spaces in a particular geographic area and process is
real-time to place vehicles at available positions .It involves using low-cost sensors, real-time data collection, and mobile-phone-enabled
automated payment systems that allow people to reserve parking in advance or very accurately predict where they will likely find a spot.
When deployed as a system, smart parking thus reduces car emissions in urban centers by reducing the need for people to needlessly
circle city blocks searching for parking. It also permits cities to carefully manage their parking supply
Smart parking helps one of the biggest problems on driving in urban areas; finding empty parking spaces and controlling illegal parking. </p>
